# SMS Launcher

![SMS Launcher ready to play](docs/launcher-ready.png)

Set up and play Super Mario Sunshine on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**. SMS Launcher guides you through setup, downloads the tools it needs, and gives you one big **Play** button when you're ready.

**Bring your own ROM is required.** You need a disc image made from your own supported Super Mario Sunshine disc. The launcher does not include a game or disc image.

## Download

**[Download SMS Launcher from the latest release](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-launcher/releases/latest)**

Choose the launcher file for your computer:

| Your computer | Download |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | The `.exe` installer |
| Mac — Intel or Apple Silicon | `SMS-Launcher-<version>-mac-universal.dmg` |
| Linux | The `.AppImage` |

The launcher requires a **64-bit computer** and an internet connection for setup. Required setup tools download automatically.

## Install

### Windows

Open the `.exe` installer and follow the steps, then open SMS Launcher.

### Mac

1. Double-click the `.dmg`.
2. Drag **SMS Launcher.app** onto **Applications** in the window that opens.
3. Eject the disk image, then open SMS Launcher from Applications.

Use the DMG for the usual drag-and-drop installation. If you download the ZIP instead, move the extracted app into Applications before opening it.

### Linux

Download the `.AppImage`, allow it to run as a program in your file manager's permissions settings, then open it.

## Set up your game

The launcher walks you through three steps:

1. **Download setup files.** Use the suggested location, or choose a different folder before downloading.
2. **Choose disc image.** Select a copy of your own original North American Super Mario Sunshine disc — **GMSE01, revision 0**. Supported files are `.iso`, `.gcm`, and Dolphin `.ciso`.
3. **Begin setup.** The launcher downloads HD textures and prepares your game on your computer. This first setup can take a while.

On Mac, setup may ask you to install Apple's Command Line Tools and, on Apple Silicon, Rosetta. Follow **Mac setup help** in the launcher.

The progress bar shows what's happening. **View build log** opens more detail; closing that view keeps setup running.

When setup finishes, press **Play**.

## Play and change settings

After setup, the main screen is just **Play** and the **Settings cog** beside it. The game opens in a centered, resizable window.

Open Settings to change screen format, smoothness, picture sharpness, and HD textures. Changes take effect the next time you start the game.

On Windows, macOS, and Linux, the defaults are **64-bit**, **HD textures on**, **Sharpest (4×)** picture sharpness, **icons at the screen edges**, and **60 fps** gameplay. Existing users keep their saved settings.

Settings → Gameplay → Frame rate offers **30 fps (GameCube native)**, **60 fps (default)**, and **120 fps (optional)**.
The previous 60 fps switch migrates to 30 or 60 without changing your saved preference.
120 fps stays available on every display; it needs more CPU/GPU performance, and a display running at 120 Hz or faster shows its full benefit.
Logos, menus, and movies stay at 30 fps.

Turn on **Settings → Visuals → Full screen** to have the game fill your display on its next launch. **Full screen type** chooses Borderless (the default) or Exclusive, which switches your display to the **Exclusive resolution** while the game runs (for example 1920×1080 on a 4K screen). **Monitor** opens the game on the same monitor as the launcher or on the primary one. F11 or Alt+Enter switches full screen while playing.

**Settings → Performance** also has **Vsync** (Off, On or Adaptive), **Skip intro movies**, and **Performance overlay**, which opens the game's frame-rate overlay at start (the backtick key toggles it in game).

**Settings → Picture** has **Anti-aliasing** (MSAA 2×, 4× or 8×), **FXAA**, **Texture filtering** (anisotropic, 2× to 16×), **Sharpening**, **Brightness**, **Picture fit** (keep its shape, stretch, or whole multiples of the original size) and **Scaling** (smooth, sharp pixels or nearest). All of them are off or unchanged by default.

**Settings → Gameplay → Invert camera X / Y** flip the C-stick camera left/right and up/down. X is inverted by default and Y is not. **Free camera** keeps the camera where you point it instead of swinging back behind Mario (L recentres it). **Camera speed** scales how fast it turns. **Mouse look** turns it with the mouse (F10 releases the mouse, a click takes it back) at the chosen **Mouse sensitivity**.

**Settings → Sound → Volume** sets the game's master volume, from 0 to 100% (full by default). It takes effect on the next launch.

- **Game files** lets you change the setup folder or choose a different disc file.
- **Manage game** has updates, rebuilding, save backups, and space cleanup.
- **Controls** sets the keyboard keys for each button: **Change** uses one key, **Add** adds another, **Reset** goes back to the default. Controllers need no setup.
- **Versions** shows your launcher, game, and setup tool versions for support.

Windows and Linux offer both 64-bit and 32-bit game builds. Keep the default **64-bit** choice unless you need 32-bit. Mac game builds are 64-bit.

### HD textures

HD textures are **on by default for first-time setup**. In Sunshine mode, this also installs all 21 enhanced cutscenes at 3× resolution, preserving their timing and original audio. Textures use about **1 GB to download** and **3 GB installed**; the movie patches add about **5.7 GB to download** and **5.8 GB installed**. Movie setup needs about **7.8 GB free**, plus room for textures if needed. You can turn HD visuals off in **Settings → Visuals**. Existing users keep their saved choice.

If HD setup is incomplete, choose **Finish HD setup** to download and prepare the missing files. Previously installed textures and movies are reused. The launcher shows download progress and checks all movies before activating the pack. Failed or cancelled setup keeps the previous pack. Your original disc and saves stay intact. Eclipse keeps its own movies.

### Updates

When a game update is ready, the main button becomes **Update & play**. Choose **Skip update & play** beside it to launch your installed version without downloading or rebuilding. Your current game stays available until the new setup succeeds.

If optional HD downloads are unfinished, **Play installed version** also lets you play now using the packs already installed. Missing HD packs stay off for that launch; your visual preferences remain saved for later setup.

Launcher updates download automatically when **Update automatically** is enabled and install when you quit. If automatic updates aren't available for your installation, download and install the latest launcher from the [releases page](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-launcher/releases/latest).

To manage updates yourself, turn off **Update automatically** in **Settings → Manage game**. Use **Update game** there when you're ready.

### Saved games and backups

The launcher keeps your save location when you update or rebuild the game. It makes dated backups before and after playing, and before game updates or cleanup.

In **Settings → Manage game → Saved games**, you can:

- **Import a Dolphin save:** drop a `.gci` file into the Saved games panel, or choose **Choose .gci file**. Confirm the import, then start the game.
- **Back up saves** whenever you want an extra copy.
- **Open backup folder** to find your backups.
- Choose an earlier backup and select **Restore backup**. Your current saves are backed up before restoring.

Saves are in the **saves** folder and backups in **save-backups**, both in the launcher's data folder, separate from the game build folders. Copy **save-backups** to another drive or cloud storage for extra protection.

Export your North American Super Mario Sunshine save (`GMSE01`, `super_mario_sunshine`) from Dolphin's Memory Card Manager as a `.gci` file. The importer transfers the entire save, including all three slots. It installs the unchanged save data and the card metadata into the save folder shown in the launcher, including custom locations, on Windows, macOS, and Linux. A fresh card does not need to be created in-game first. Other games, regions, raw memory cards, and `.sav`/`.gcs` files are not supported.

The launcher asks before importing, warns if save block checksums fail, and makes a verified backup of your existing card before writing. A failed import restores the files it replaced. Import is disabled while the game or another launcher task is running. The source `.gci` is never changed or uploaded. Restore a **Before Dolphin import** backup to recover previous progress.

The conversion follows the GCI header/payload approach demonstrated by the community [GCI-to-DAT converter](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/33072655/gci-to-dat.3.html), with metadata and index creation for the port's card backend. Header fields follow [Dolphin's GCI directory entry format](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/master/Source/Core/Core/HW/GCMemcard/GCMemcard.h).

### Optional: Super Mario Eclipse

Super Mario Eclipse is a fan-made expansion available in Settings. Enable it and choose **Install Eclipse mod**, then finish any setup the launcher requests. Turn it off to return to the original game.

Eclipse needs a full, unmodified North American ISO; compressed CISO files won't work for its patch. Eclipse has been verified on Linux and is experimental on Windows and Mac.

## Need help?

- **Setup or a download failed:** open **View activity** on the error message to see what happened, then try setup again. A failed HD download leaves **Finish HD setup** available to retry.
- **A game update failed:** use **Play installed version** in Manage game. After a successful update, **Play previous version** is also available there.
- **Mac says the launcher is on a read-only volume:** quit the launcher, move SMS Launcher.app into Applications, eject the DMG, and reopen it from Applications.
- **Need to free up space:** use **See removable files** in Manage game, then **Free up space**. The launcher keeps your disc file and saved games.

## For developers

SMS Launcher is an Electron frontend for [sms-pc-port](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-pc-port). Game preparation stays on the user's computer and requires their own disc image.

### Run locally

Install **Node.js 22.12 or newer** and npm, then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-launcher.git
cd sms-launcher
npm ci
npm start
```

For development alongside the port, use sibling folders:

```text
workspace/
├── sms-port/
└── sms-launcher/
```

Development runs detect a neighboring `sms-port/` automatically. Packaged installs use the launcher's data folder by default. Existing setup folders can be selected in **Settings → Game files**.

### Where files go

Everything the launcher downloads or creates goes in one data folder: the game (`sms-pc-port`) and its updates, build tools (`build-tools`), saves (`saves`), save backups (`save-backups`) and key bindings. It is the folder chosen with **Change folder** during setup, or by default the launcher's own data folder (`%APPDATA%\sms-launcher` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/sms-launcher` on macOS, `~/.config/sms-launcher` on Linux). The program itself goes wherever the installer put it. Only the launcher's preferences and Electron's cache stay in the default data folder, so it can find the chosen one.

Earlier versions kept saves where the game puts them by default (`%APPDATA%\sms-port\card-a` on Windows) and backups in `~/SMS Launcher Backups`. The first start of this version copies them into the data folder and leaves the originals. A setup that chose a folder but has not built a game yet moves to that folder; build tools downloaded before stay where they are, and the activity log says where.

### Test and package

```sh
npm test
npm run dist
```

To make a universal Mac package on macOS:

```sh
npm run dist -- --mac --universal
```

Packages contain the launcher. Game source, disc images, optional mods, compiled games, and saves are not bundled.

The separate **Smoke test build tools** workflow downloads checksum-verified tool archives and compiles the exact source in `src/game-release.json` without a ROM. It checks both 32-bit and 64-bit games on Windows and Linux, and 64-bit games on Intel and Apple Silicon Mac hosts. These checks are a required release gate; they do not publish game binaries.

### Build tools

The launcher checks available tools and downloads prepared archives when needed. Downloads are checksum-verified and stay in its data folder. Users do not need to install Git, Homebrew, or MSYS2 themselves.

| Host | Prepared tools |
| --- | --- |
| Linux x64 | Git, CMake, Python, GCC, SDL2, EGL, Make, patch, binutils, 7-Zip, and an x64-host 32-bit cross compiler with its SDK and graphics libraries |
| Windows x64 | A prepared MSYS2 tree with 64-bit helper programs and compilers for both 32-bit and 64-bit games |
| Mac Intel / Apple Silicon | Native LLVM, CMake, Python, Git, Make, patch, and 7-Zip; Apple's Command Line Tools and Rosetta are installed separately when required |

Tool archives are separate release assets, with source archives and package notices. Matching versions are reused. Changed archives install into separate folders, preserving tools needed by earlier game builds. Each game build records its tool location.

See [build tool publishing](docs/build-tools.md) for archive preparation and publishing.

### Versions and releases

| Component | Version location | When it changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Launcher | `package.json` | Launcher behavior, UI, or selecting a new game/tools release |
| Game source | `src/game-release.json` | A tested port commit and its exact decomp commit |
| Build tools | Platform entries in `src/tool-assets.json` and `src/mac-tool-assets.json` | When that OS or architecture needs different tools |

Source or tool changes require a game rebuild. Visual preferences and launcher-only updates reuse the existing game. The launcher selects compatible versions; users don't manage branches or commits.

**Launcher release:** run `npm version patch --no-git-tag-version`, commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, and push to `main`. The release workflow creates the tag and draft, verifies the game with the published tools, builds the Linux AppImage, universal Mac DMG/ZIP, and Windows installer, then publishes after all checks pass. Documentation-only changes don't need a version bump.

**Game update:**

1. Push a complete port revision, including its decomp gitlink, to the branch selected in `src/game-release.json` — currently `main`.
2. Run `npm run update:game` or `npm run update:game -- <port-commit>`. It records exact source revisions, assigns a dated game version, and bumps the launcher version. Selecting the same revision makes no changes.
3. Review and commit `src/game-release.json`, `package.json`, and `package-lock.json`, then push to `main` to run the release gate.

**Tool update:** publish the affected OS or Mac architecture through the separate tool workflow, adopt its generated manifest entry with the new immutable URL and checksum, and bump the launcher. Preserve existing archives and hashes. See [the toolset workflow](docs/build-tools.md).

### Launcher updates and Mac signing

Release packages embed their GitHub update feed, check on startup and every 30 minutes, and install downloaded updates on quit. The Mac ZIP is required by the automatic updater; the DMG is the recommended user installation.

macOS automatic updates require signed builds. Mac releases are signed with a self-signed certificate: run `scripts/make-mac-cert.sh` once, store its output as the `MAC_CSC_LINK` and `MAC_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` secrets, and back it up. Installs only accept updates signed with that same certificate, or a later Developer ID build of the same app, so never generate a replacement. Without the secrets, builds are unsigned and can only be installed by hand. Windows signing uses `WIN_CSC_LINK` and `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`. `SMS_LAUNCHER_UPDATE_URL` can override the embedded feed with an HTTPS generic feed. Local packages without a feed cannot fetch new launcher releases automatically.

### Save storage and recovery

The launcher honors `SMS_SAVE_DIR` or `save_dir` in the port's `settings.txt` and displays the resolved path. Otherwise saves go in `saves` in the data folder. Verified backups live in `save-backups` there, outside the port folders.

Source updates build in separate folders and switch preferences only after success. Rebuilds preserve the previous binary and metadata; a recovery journal restores interrupted builds on the next start. Cleanup refuses custom save folders inside removable build output. Restore verifies the backup and saves current progress first. Disc images and patched discs are not included in save backups. A single-instance lock prevents overlapping updates and save operations.

### HD cutscene integration

The HD textures switch controls both textures and Sunshine's complete movie pack.
Movie patches are reconstructed using the player's own North American Sunshine disc image (GMSE01); Python is needed for installation, but FFmpeg and an AI runtime are not needed to install or play them.
The catalog pins every original movie, downloaded patch and reconstructed movie by SHA-256.
The installed pack carries over across game updates.
See the [port's HD cutscene guide](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-pc-port/blob/main/docs/HD-CUTSCENES.md) for manual and offline installation.
